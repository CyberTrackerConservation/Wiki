<h5>
    Why are there two versions?
</h5>
<hr />
<p>
    Windows applications can be installed in two different ways: for a single user or for all users.
</p>
<p>
    A single-user install means that CyberTracker will only be available for the user who installed it. This is the recommended install type.
</p>
<p>
    An all-user/admin install means that all users on the machine use a single installed version. In order to use this version, you must have administrator rights on your system.
